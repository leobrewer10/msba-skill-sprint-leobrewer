This repo creates code that helps determine the daytime population density in specific counties of the bay area, ultimately creating a visual to show this density.
This is useful skill to help me learn how to create a visual like this out of population data, we can see that they use specific code to create the map of the bay area in the first place and then divide it into the specific counties.
Then we can see that they assign colors to the 'quantile bins' to create the population density, showing which areas have these specific densities. I think that this could work well for a company, however if it was lets say a retail company trying to determine where to build a new shop, it might be useful to use data that doesn't ignore some aspects of the daytime population like this data and model says it ignores, for example tourists and shoppers etc. this info if it could be attained would be much more accurate and valuable to a business when making an accurate population density map.
